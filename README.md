# Recipe Metric Converter.

This is a simple metric converter that converts from imperial to metric system. Simply take a photo and the app will convert the imperial units to metric units.
It is a PWA so you can install it on your phone and use it offline.
The app fully runs on the client side, so no data is sent to the server. `tesseract.js` runs in an WASM container.
